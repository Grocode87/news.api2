Kitchen Worker (Former Employee) - Nanaimo, BC - 25 August 2020 I enjoyed working for the Salvation Army because I believe in their mission statement: to provide for those who cannot provide for themselves in order to show the Love of God. A typical day at work included a total cleaning of the dining, bathroom, hallways and dishwashing area. As well at taking out the garbage and doing compost, making tea and helping the servers, organizing donations, and turning stock over. Management was alright... I have to admit though that the safety was lacking for us employees and the communication from upper management was poor. As well as this, i was locked in the freezer for over an hour because they did not fix it for 8 years. In spite of this, I still hold this job as one of my favorites because i just love the people I worked with and for, the homeless are a wonderful and wise group of people. That, and being able to exercise Love and Empathy on a regular basis made me a happy person.

Didn't make much in tips at my location. Hours were disappointing but staff were great and incredibly encouraging in terms of helping you progress professionally. I was treated equally and with respect. Work/life balance is difficult due to the hours but that will be the case in any job within the food industry. Great job if you one day wanna become a server and are hardworking (no promises). Management will notice your work ethic and acknowledge it. Daytimes tend to be a lot more slow paced and relaxed but will face lunch and dinner rushes. Very little stress during your training as well once you get the hang of things. Job will teach you people skills and make you more sociable. Was this review helpful?

The work environment can be pretty stressful and high energy during busy periods, but overall its a good place to be.

The management feels like they just came right out of highschool with how petty and catty and gossipy they all are and they don’t care about embarrassing other staff in front of their peers. They can’t explain how tip out works. They make me pay for meals when a table dines and dashes. I stay because I hope upper management will visit and see how poorly run this BPs is. I stay because the best time to look for other work is when you have work. The managers are a**holes. If you can ignore that, and their followers, it’s not too bad to work here.

Communication is disgusting & none of the BP culture is followed at all. Recognition for your work means nothing & getting a raise is based on how close you are with the owners son. Don't waste your time theirs better jobs out there Pros Playing dress up, reliving highschool glory, working long hours for nothing if you're bored Cons Long hours, no respect, no benefits, expected to know things right away, no follow ups or coaching, no structure or system Was this review helpful?

Hostess (Former Employee) - 106 Jasper Ave - 2 October 2020 Overall liked the job and was very pleased with my co-workers and staff. I was unlucky that the manager of that time was a flaming homosexual that had a serious hat read towards woman and caused me so much disgust I left the work because the feeling he gave me of being disgusting because I was a female.

Someone was fired a few feet away from people I was around. Can be very catty up front, very angering in the back. But when it is no longer a rush it can be like a second family. I do recommend if you work best in fast paced environments because above all, I love my boston pizza family Pros Can feel like a second family, good when you need fast paced environments.

BP is a good stepping stone to get kitchen experience. Like most kitchens, they are flexible with scheduling. Decent pay, but that is mostly due to the bump from tip pool, otherwise it's a close to minimum wage job. Pros Flexable schedule, good experience, team is nice Cons Very little room for advancement, equipment takes a long time to get fixed, old building Was this review helpful?

There training system are in place but they lack the franchiser who care enough to hire the right GM to train you. Your RBM for GTA and Kingston does really give care at all, he make it look like he hold it up to BP Standard, but he does not have any repercussion for Franchiser when they are not fully invested in there business to train the start properly.

This job is legit just for students, and if you want a positive work environment please look for something else. This is a mentally and physically draining job, not something you would want to do for a long time. One of my main issues is I never got properly trained, and when I do make minor mistakes the supervisors will make a big fuss. Instead of talking to me in person and showing me what I did wrong and how to correct it. Instead, they write very passive-aggressive notes and make you sign it during your next shift. Another major issue was the hours we got paid for, we use "Time well Scheduled" to check our schedules. And on the schedule you can see they round down the hours to pay you for as little as possible. For example you have a shift 5-9:15 pm, if you come in at 4:50 pm they are going to round that to 5 pm and if you leave at 9:22 pm they're going to round it to 9:15. Those unpaid 17 minutes do add up A LOT, when you go and look at Time well Scheduled. Definitely the worst place I've ever worked. Pros Nothing Cons No employee discount, had to pay for uniform shirts and sweaters, they take $1 out your paycheque once a month for "free food event" that rarely happens Was this review helpful?

The staff has zero personality and no life skills. Thus, that leaves them with no ability to effectively communicate with customers. The managers are mediocre at best. Again, zero personality and no management skills. No leadership, only gossip. In the absence of leadership, chaos reigns.

First thing i want to say is don't expect much in terms of pay, even as a manager you're sitting at the 14-17 dollor a hour rate which for a Manager is not great at all. Benefits are very basic and profit sharing is not guaranteed, everything is dependent on the location if your dealer/owner is cheap there will be no yearly raises or benefits which chances are you won't be getting them Nobody seems happy their, even the managers. Working at Canadian Tire is very boring and tedious, as a manager you will have to work 9-11 hours shifts and during the non busy retail seasons your hour may get cut which will cancel your benefits, a fare warning there will be no training and communication is seriously lacking. Before you get hired on be sure to ask a lot of questions about your pay/benefits. Pros 10% discount Cons Basic Benefits, Pay is low Was this review helpful?

I worked at the one on Ogilvie road. I have never seen worse management, a dirtier store or been a part of such an unfriendly group of staff. The managers were awful at communicating with the employees and they often changed the rules. Some would also constantly undermine me when I had issues with customers at the cash. They also implemented a system in their computer where you would not be payed for the time after you shift when you had to balance your till, something that is required after every shift. I feel we should have been paid for that time as well. Definitely would not recommend! Pros Hours were mostly flexible Cons Cheap, dirty environment, poor management Was this review helpful?

The manager had no clue as to what my skill-set is and kept assigning tasks that a different team is responsible for, only because he was in a spitting match with the other team's manager.

You are moved up if you know the right people only, not by your work ethic. I was in four different positions at the bank over eight years and knew a lot. I was let go because I wouldn't sell products to business people who only did the bank deposits and banked elsewhere. My skills were not put to use in any other department. Managers were bullying me to sell more but my philosophy and the bank's philosophy were not the same at the end of eight years of service. Only work at a bank if you love to sell. This bank is not customer service driven! Pros Good benefits Cons Too much selling and pressure to do so. Not customer service oriented; Was this review helpful?

They will turn on you quickly, and they will disrespect the trust you 'seemed' to have built with them. This might be a good short term gig, but long term... Keep eyes open for other opportunities.

On paper you can make unlimited commissions, but you need to make $4500 minimum in sales every single month to get any substantial commissions. If you miss the target by even a few dollars, the commission goes down to peanuts. Also, RBC does not provide any leads or helps with the prospecting. You have to find your own leads and do your own prospecting. And there is constant pressure to make sales and book meetings. We are told constantly that this is not a 9-5 job and that we need to work hard to build "our" business. That means working evenings and weekends. Just not worth the peanuts you get for salary.

On the day of my contract termination,the manager from myAdvisor application, told me that he was going to make harassment complaint on me to VP development. As he said he did complain on me. I sent an email with evidence to VP which clearly proves that he was the one who was harassing me. Still my contract got terminated without any investigation. Within few minutes, I was threatened by my consultancy not to contact or send any email to RBC employees. I am writing this review to stay from this place.

This is not a company for young girls to work in. I was sexually harassed by a worker who had repeatedly sexually harassed girls prior to me. Of course, Sobeys pretended nothing happened and swept it under the rug. This allowed the man to continue to sexually harass multiple innocent women. My safety and the safety of others were of no concern to this company. I have issues many years later that lead to anxiety in working in other places.

After covering roughly 20 shifts throughout the year and never missing one of my own, I figured someone would cover my shift but I was mistaken. Everyone just so happened to be "busy", whether it was a doctor's appointment on a Saturday, or their cousins dogs brother was in town for the weekend. I had approximately a week left at the time so I just quit on the spot, as they had made it clear that they do not value the lower level staff and they are just underpaid cogs in the corporate machine.

I was lied to in the interview about my tasks and overall position. I was over worked and badly informed on what was my duty versus the duties put onto me by senior associates. Pandemic hit and no PPE/Guidelines to protect workers. No MSDS access (chemical info), and then I was given incorrect information. Forget bathroom breaks. Made to take lunch an hour before the end of a full shift, if at all (discouraged in favour of working multiple positions). It all went very down hill. Incredibly bad management and HR.
