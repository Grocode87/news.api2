I want to cluster using tf idf

get a centroid for clusters - get tf-idf from each cluster and calculate average



get all old and new articles, calculate tf idf scores

loop through old articles and calculate cluster centroids
create [cluster centroids] list

compare every article to every cluster centroid

for each article find a close matching cluster, add or create new cluster
